# Neorenderer
This project is an updated version of my old software renderer simply titled 'renderer'.
It can also be found on my GitHub Repositories section.

I worked really hard to create the original renderer and I learned a lot whilst doing so.
However, with the power of hindsight, I can confidently say that there are much better ways
to do the same thing, ways that I will try my best to employ in this project.
